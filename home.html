    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <h3>
        <ul>
            The United States Congress, as outlined in the U.S. Constitution, stands as the legislative branch of the federal government. With its bicameral structure consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives, Congress wields a range of powers and responsibilities essential to the functioning of the American democratic system. These powers, carefully enumerated in the Constitution, reflect the Founding Fathers' intent to establish a system of checks and balances, preventing the concentration of power in any single branch of government.

        <li>Legislative Authority:</li>
            The primary and foundational power vested in Congress is the authority to legislate. Both the House of Representatives and the Senate possess the ability to propose, debate, and ultimately pass bills into law. This legislative process involves the introduction of bills, committee reviews, floor debates, and finally, a vote. The bicameral nature of Congress ensures that proposed legislation undergoes thorough scrutiny, reflecting the diverse perspectives of the American populace.
        </p>
            <li>Taxation and Budgetary Control:</li>
            Congress holds the purse strings of the nation, with the House of Representatives initiating all revenue-related legislation. The power to levy taxes and approve budgets is a crucial aspect of congressional authority. The framers of the Constitution envisioned that such financial powers would serve as a check on executive authority, ensuring that the government's fiscal policies align with the will of the people.
        </p>
        <li>Foreign Policy Engagement:</li>
        While the President is the primary architect of foreign policy, Congress plays a pivotal role in shaping and overseeing these endeavors. The Senate, in particular, holds the authority to ratify treaties negotiated by the President and confirm key diplomatic appointments. This division of foreign policy powers reflects the framers' desire to prevent unilateral executive action and promote a collaborative approach to international relations.
        </p>
        <li>Oversight of the Military:</li>
        The Constitution grants Congress significant authority over the nation's armed forces. Congress possesses the exclusive power to declare war, a fundamental check on the President's role as Commander in Chief. Additionally, the power to raise and support armies, maintain a navy, and regulate the military allows Congress to ensure civilian control over the armed forces and prevent the emergence of a standing army threatening civil liberties.
        </P>
        <li>Impeachment and Removal:</li>
        In times of egregious misconduct, Congress holds the power of impeachment. The House of Representatives can initiate impeachment proceedings against federal officials, including the President, for "high crimes and misdemeanors." If impeached, the Senate conducts a trial to determine guilt or innocence. This power serves as a constitutional safeguard against abuse of executive authority and underscores the principle that no one is above the law.
        </p>
        <li>Judicial Authority:</li>
        Congress also influences the judiciary through its power to establish and regulate federal courts. The Constitution grants Congress the authority to determine the jurisdiction of these courts, shape their structure, and even impeach federal judges for misconduct. This ensures that the judiciary remains accountable and operates within the bounds of constitutional principles.
